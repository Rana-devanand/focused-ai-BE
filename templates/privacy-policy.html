      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to NeuroTrack ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to
        protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on
        our specialized AI-powered passive productivity platform. This Privacy
        Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your
        information when you use our mobile application (the "App") and our
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing or using our Service, you signify your acceptance of this
        Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy,

      <h3>A. Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address,

        related to the App.
      </p>

      <h3>B. Passive Data Collection (AI Analysis)</h3>
      <p>
        To provide our core "passive productivity" features, the App requests
        permission to access specific data on your device:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Calendar Data:</strong> We access your calendar events to
          analyze your schedule, identify potential burnout periods, and suggest
          optimal focus times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Email Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we may
          access email metadata and content to categorize tasks, detect
          deadlines, and provide workload summaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App Usage Stats:</strong> We track application usage time to
          help you understand your digital habits and improve focus.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Sensitive data processing for AI analysis is
        performed securely. We prioritize on-device processing where feasible,
        and any data transmitted to our servers for advanced AI analysis is
        encrypted and anonymized where possible.
